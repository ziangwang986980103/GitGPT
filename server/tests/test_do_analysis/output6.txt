design: 
change the chunksize and maximal legnth of a text to be summarized wihtout chunking to be 8000 characters
The analysis of the repo takes 858.1324392990023 seconds. This is much shorter than the output4.txt which also 
analyzes the memgpt repo. However, this design make the summary's quality much worse.
