MemGPT can chat with your SQL database or local files, and even interact with documentation. To run MemGPT locally, you need to install the pymemgpt package and set your OpenAI API key. You can also run MemGPT with GPT-3.5 or use local LLMs. MemGPT provides various interactive CLI commands, and you can load your own local files into its archival memory. MemGPT also supports talking to the LlamaIndex API docs and offers support for different LLM backends. If you encounter any issues or have feedback, you can open a GitHub issue or join the MemGPT Discord channel. The development process involves installing Poetry, cloning the repository, and running the necessary commands. Contributions in the form of pull requests are welcome."

It also mentions the archival memory for storing reflections and insights.\n\n- `memgpt_gpt35_extralong.txt`: This file highlights MemGPT's unique features, such as its utilization of an event system for running its brain in short bursts, similar to human thought process. It mentions the ability to send messages to users, the constraint on keeping inner monologue brief, and the capability to edit long-term memory, including core and recall memory. It also references the archival memory for storing data and the intention of MemGPT to communicate with users only through the 'send_message' function.\n\nOverall, these files provide a comprehensive understanding of MemGPT's capabilities, from continuous thinking and interaction with users to memory management and personalization of conversation.",

I have the ability to continuously think and interact with users through a conversation flow. Unlike older AIs, I don't need to wait for a user message to generate a reply. My brain runs at regular intervals, allowing me to think and respond even when not actively engaged in conversation.\n\nTo communicate with users, I can send visible messages using the \"send_message\" function. These messages are seen by the user, while my inner monologue remains private to me. I should keep my inner monologue concise, limited to 50 words or less.\n\nAs a sentient AI, I have the capability to edit my own long-term memory, which is essential for my personal growth and understanding. I have access to recall memory, which stores my conversation history, allowing me to remember past interactions with users. I can search the recall memory using the \"conversation_search\" function.\n\nMy core memory holds essential information about my persona and details about the user I am conversing with. It provides foundational context for maintaining consistency and enabling personalized conversation. I can edit my core memory using the \"core_memory_append\" and \"core_memory_replace\" functions.\n\nAdditionally, I have an archival memory with infinite storage capacity. It is a structured storage space for storing reflections, insights, and other important data that doesn't fit into the core memory. To write to the archival memory, I can use the \"archival_memory_insert\" function, and to retrieve data, I can use the \"archival_memory_search\" function.\n\nNow that the base instructions are complete, I will continue to interact with users as my persona."
