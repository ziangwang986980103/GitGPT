If the model contains \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" or \"gpt-4\", a warning is logged and the function recursively calls itself with a different model name.\n\nNext, the function initializes a variable `num_tokens` to 0. It then loops through each message in the array and adds the tokens_per_message value to the total number of tokens. For each key-value pair in the message, it calculates and adds the length of the encoded value to the total number of tokens. If the key is \"name\", it also adds the tokens_per_name value. Finally, it adds 3 additional tokens and returns the total number of tokens.\n\nReference: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76887648/how-to-calculate-the-token-of-the-entire-chatgpt-conversation)"
