It drops lines before the specified starting line, skips the first line, stops at the first empty line, and then splits each remaining line by spaces to extract the first word, which is the command.\n\nThe `get_docker_commands` function executes the `docker` command using the `subprocess` module and captures the output. It checks if the output contains the string \"Management Commands:\" to determine if it is a newer version of Docker that has management commands. It then calls the `_parse_commands` function to extract the management commands and regular commands.
