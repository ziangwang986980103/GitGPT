The Components panel serializes tree changes and reconstructs the tree in the frontend based on defined operations. The frontend requests additional information about an element on demand. Profiling tools and strategies are used to identify and fix performance issues, with a focus on minimizing bridge traffic and lazy computations. Specific details include:\n- Components panel: Serializes and reconstructs tree changes based on operations, and stores tree information in a map.\n- Inspecting an element: Requests additional information about an element on demand, and uses a polling strategy to avoid sending large amounts of data across the bridge.\n- Profiler: Stores profiling data in the backend and minimizes performance impact by delaying the computation of charts and combining profiling data after the session is completed.\n- Package specific details: Provides an overview diagram of the Devtools extension."
