The project can be used to create a web file editor/reader by implementing a FileSystemProvider through an extension. Additionally, the proposed API can be used to implement a TextSearchProvider and FileSearchProvider. There is also a sample project provided in this repository that demonstrates the usage of vscode-web. However, it should be noted that the sample project is not fully functional as it lacks a FileSystemProvider extension.
